Cascade - Quant-um Stock Trading

This is a python program which uses quantitative investment strategies
and technical analysis to predict the future of the market. The two
theories I have developed (and their conjectures) are as follows:

Correlation Analysis Theory:
1. The market is a derivative of human behavior/decision making.
2. Human behavior is chaotic in nature, seemingly random but deterministic.
3. If human behavior is chaotic, then so is the market.
4. As humans are connected and affect each others decisions, then assets are connected and affect each others data.
5. Measuring the connections/correlations of assets gives a more accurate prediction of future data than analyzing one asset for patterns that don't exist.

Signal Processing Theory:
1. The market can be seen as a wave/signal.
2. The market can be broken down into different frequencies/waves that make the resulting pattern of data.
3. The frequencies/waves that make up the market can be analyzed by the wavelet transform to identify short-term and long-term patterns.
4. Repeating patterns or emerging patterns can be used to predict future data and make a profit.

These theories are currently being refined in the code and I need to
write code to simulate/test models against historical data. The original
name "Cascade" was derived from the cascade algorithm, which used the
wave function collapse to generate random numbers. In this case the
algorithm randomly generated a sudoku board, which is a simple example
that operates on the principle of the wave function collapse. There
are plenty of examples out there that reveal that random stock trading
is profitable in the long term. A hedge fund called MonkeyDex used
a chimp throwing darts to decide which assets to buy. It made a 212%
return in 1999. A youtuber by the name Michael Reeves used a goldfish
instead and outcompeted the Nasdaq and Wallstreetbets. While randomness
is a good strategy (apparently), I am developing theories to solve the
puzzle of the market (because it is fun).
