Cascade - Quantum Stock Trading

This is a simple python program which uses the wave function collapse
to decide which stocks to buy and sell day-in and day-out. Truly random
and quantum stock trading. Choosing random stocks actually does
outperform the S&P 500. A hedge fund that bases it's stock trading
decisions on a chimp throwing darts. The fund is called MonkeyDex and
it was able to outperform more than 6000 professional brokers on wall
street and delivered a 213% gain in 1999. The results are obvious,
randomly choosing stocks is statistically better than trusting
so-called "professional" brokers. This is what this program aims to
achieve, a net gain on one's money using only randomly determined trading.
